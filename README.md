# DevSandbox

_A creative mess of scripts, mini-projects, and random development ideas._

Welcome to **DevSandbox**, a collection of experiments, small projects, and snippets across various programming languages and frameworks. This repository is a space where I explore coding concepts, try out new tools, and learn by building.

## üåü What's Inside?

This repository contains:

- **Python Scripts**: Small programs solving specific problems, automating stuff, or exploring Python libraries.
- **Java Projects**: Mini projects, design pattern implementations, and experiments in Java.
- **C# Projects**: Includes WinForms applications and other small C# experiments.
- **Web Projects**: Random web pages built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Django Apps**: Minor Django projects used to learn and explore the framework.
- **Lua Projects**: Simple scripts and projects to practice and explore the Lua scripting language.
- **Miscellaneous**: Other coding experiments and ideas that don‚Äôt fit neatly into a category.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Here are some of the languages, frameworks, and tools used in this repository:

- **Languages**: Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, Lua, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks**: Django, WinForms
- **Others**: Various libraries and APIs depending on the project

## üí° Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A **learning hub** for practicing programming concepts and frameworks.
- A **playground** for trying out new ideas and tools.
- A **reference** for revisiting past experiments and code snippets.
