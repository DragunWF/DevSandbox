## Description

Hello, this is just a repository for my mini-projects and mini-scripts in Python. I mainly just
use this repository to store my mini projects, test projects, and my small automation scripts.

## Mini-Projects

- [AutoJoinZoom](https://github.com/DragunWF/AutoJoinZoom) - An
  automation bot that automatically joins me in my zoom classes. [(Now moved to its own repository)](https://github.com/DragunWF/AutoJoinZoom)
