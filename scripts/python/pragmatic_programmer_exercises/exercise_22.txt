You've identified the need to validate and convert an input field from a string
into an integer between 18 and 150. The overall transformation is described by

field contents as string
    -> {validate & convert}
    -> { :ok, value } | { :error, reason }

field contents as string
    -> { string -> convert }
    -> { if value >= 18 & value <= 150 then }
        -> { :ok, value }
    -> { else }
        -> { :error, reason }
