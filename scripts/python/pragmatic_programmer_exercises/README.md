## Description

These are some of my answers to the exercises of the book, The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt.

## Something to know

I don't keep all of the answers here. Some of the are private in other places. Furthermore, I have separate private repository for my notes and answers to exercises whenever I self-study other books or Udemy courses.
